## Goal of the Competition


In this competition, you'll detect football (soccer) passes—including throw-ins and crosses—and challenges in original Bundesliga matches. 

You'll develop a computer vision model that can automatically classify these events in long video recordings.

Your work will help scale the data collection process. 

Automatic event annotation could enable event data from currently unexplored competitions, like youth or semi-professional leagues or even training sessions.
